# OVA Examples

There are many different options which can be used for OVAs to accompany this lab. 

**Note:** The actual OS doesn't matter for the purposes of this repo and the associated session. There are no requirements to interact with the underlying OS, but the intention was to make this as close to a real world example as possible.

Some examples: 
- VMware Photon: [link](https://github.com/vmware/photon/wiki/Downloading-Photon-OS)
- Tiny Linux: [link](http://tinycorelinux.net/)
