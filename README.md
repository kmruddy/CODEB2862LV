**Title**: vSphere Automation Solutions â€“ PowerCLI vs. Terraform <br>
**Abstract**: VMware vSphere automation has always been a hot topic for customers that support large virtual environments. Automation through scripting, mostly by using PowerShell and VMware PowerCLI, has been the preferred automation option for our customers for a long time. Lately, infrastructure-as-code (IaC) solutions like Terraform have gained popularity among virtual infrastructure administrators. Join this session to learn the differences between the two automation models, the advantages and disadvantages of each, and start getting the best of both worlds. We prepared some interesting demos for specific tasks you can complete with PowerCLI and Terraform. These demos will help you understand the specifics of each automation tool better.
